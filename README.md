<h1>Enhancement of the Linux lsblk and df Commands through Shell Scripting</h1>
<p>This project is a shell script that provides additional options to the lsblk and df commands on Linux (Ubuntu).
    The script enhances the functionality of the existing commands by allowing the user to display and filter the
    output in multiple ways, such as sorting by device type, size, or usage.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To use the script, simply download or clone the repository to your local machine and run the menu.sh script in
    the terminal. The script will prompt you for the desired options and display the output accordingly.</p>
